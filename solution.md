# Next.js AKS Deployment with DevSecOps Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to securely build, package, scan, and deploy a **Next.js** application to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** using a GitHub Actions pipeline. The deployment includes integration with **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**, **Helm charts**, **ingress controller**, and **security best practices**.

---

## üìå Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, ensure you have:
- An Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed or access to Azure Cloud Shell
- A GitHub repository with the necessary secrets configured

To securely deploy to Azure from GitHub Actions, the following secrets are configured in the repository under  
**Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**:

- **`AZURE_CREDENTIALS`**  
  A JSON object containing credentials for a service principal with access to Azure subscription.  
  Used by the `azure/login@v1` action to authenticate to Azure.  
  It includes:
  - `clientId`
  - `clientSecret`
  - `subscriptionId`
  - `tenantId`

- **`ACR_USERNAME`**  
  The username for Azure Container Registry (ACR).  
  This is typically the name of ACR instance (e.g., `nextjsbasicapp`).

- **`ACR_PASSWORD`**  
  The password (secret) for the ACR.


## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The pipeline (`Deploy to AKS`) is triggered on each push to the `main` branch or manually via GitHub UI. It includes the following steps:

### ‚úÖ Steps Explained

1. **Checkout Code**  
   Clones the repository to the GitHub Actions runner.

2. **Semantic Version Calculation**
   Fetches the latest Git tags, increments the patch version (0.0.X), and creates a new Git tag. This version is then used for the build artifacts.

3. **Node.js Setup & Install**  
   Installs Node.js v22 and project dependencies via `npm install`.

4. **Security Checks**  
   - `npm audit fix`: Automatically fixes known vulnerabilities.
   - `npm audit --audit-level=high`: Detects remaining high/critical issues.
   - `npm run lint`: Ensures code quality and coding standards.

5. **Build the App**  
   Executes the Next.js build process (`npm run build`).

6. **Static Code Analysis**  
   - **CodeQL Analysis**: Detects security vulnerabilities in TypeScript code using GitHub‚Äôs built-in scanner.

7. **Build & Push Docker Image to ACR**  
   - Uses `buildx` to build and tag the Docker image with `latest` and the version tag.
   - Pushes image to ACR.

8. **Inject Version into Helm**  
   Updates the `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` with the correct version and image tag.

9. **Package & Push Helm Chart to ACR**  
   - Packages Helm chart.
   - Logs in to ACR.
   - Pushes the chart to the OCI registry in ACR.

10. **Helm Deployment to AKS**  
   - Uses Helm to deploy the application to AKS using the updated chart.
   - Waits for pod readiness and validates deployment.

## üåê Exposing the Application with Ingress

The application is exposed via an Ingress resource that provisions an external **public IP** with support for both HTTP and HTTPS.

### ‚úÖ Ingress Overview

After deployment, the Azure Load Balancer public IP can be obtained with

```bash
kubectl get ingress
```

The output includes:
- `ADDRESS`: `128.203.114.45` ‚Äî Azure Load Balancer public IP
- `PORTS`: Supports both HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)

---

### üåç Accessing the App

The app is publicly available via the IP address:

```
https://128.203.114.45
```

Or, more conveniently, via a dynamic DNS domain using [nip.io](https://nip.io):

```
https://nextjsbasicapp.128.203.114.45.nip.io/
```

This works automatically because `*.nip.io` resolves the domain to the IP embedded in it (`128.203.114.45`).  
No DNS configuration is required ‚Äî great for demos and test environments.
